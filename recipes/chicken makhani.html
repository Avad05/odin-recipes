        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><b>Chicken Makhani</b>, also known as Butter Chicken, is a popular Indian dish that originates from the culinary traditions of North India, particularly Punjab. It is a rich and creamy curry made with tender pieces of chicken cooked in a mildly spiced tomato-based sauce. The key ingredients typically include butter (hence the name), cream, tomatoes, various spices such as garam masala, cumin, and coriander, as well as garlic, ginger, and sometimes cashew paste for added richness and texture</p>
        <p>The dish is known for its velvety smooth texture and a balance of flavors that combines the tanginess of tomatoes with the richness of dairy products like butter and cream. It is mildly spiced, making it appealing to a wide range of palates, and often garnished with fresh coriander leaves or a drizzle of cream before serving.</p>
        <p><b>Chicken Makhani</b> is usually enjoyed with rice or Indian breads like naan or roti, and it has gained popularity worldwide for its comforting and flavorful profile.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.</li>
            <li>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.</li>
            <li>Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
