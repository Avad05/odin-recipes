        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A <b>sandwich</b>is a versatile and popular food item consisting of one or more layers of bread or a bread-like base, with a filling placed between them.

        <p><b>Sandwiches</b> can be cold or hot, depending on the ingredients used. They are typically portable and convenient, making them a popular choice for lunches, picnics, and quick meals. Sandwiches also come in many regional varieties and styles, reflecting local culinary traditions and preferences.</p>
